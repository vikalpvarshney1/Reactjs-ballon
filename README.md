Step1: - A user can enter a number in the "5 circle" text box and click shoot button. This would move 
the corresponding circle into the empty div. In the figure below, user entered 2 and clicked 
shoot button, which moved the 2nd circle into the empty div.

Step2: – The circles get reorganised. Therefore the purple circle which was at 3rd position 
now moves up and occupies 2rd position.

Step3:  The user can shoot multiple circles and the corresponding circles would move in to 
the empty div. the user again entered 3 and corresponding circle got 
moved into the empty div.

Step4: - – The user can get back the circles that were shot by clicking the corresponding 
circles residing in the empty div. Example the user clicked red circle which was inside the 
empty div and the red came back to its original position (that is second position).
